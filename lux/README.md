Simple service management program in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

**Archived from its own (now-deleted) repository.** The idea with this project was to unify many of my services under one service manager that handled all of my inter-service communication and management needs. Over time, I realized there are probably better ways to do this and that this project is never going to get finished, so it doesn't deserve its own repository. Plans for this project were huge, but my priorities shifted over time.
