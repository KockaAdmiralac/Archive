# Ban users :^)
This collection of scripts was used for an April Fools joke on the
[Undertale Wiki's Discord server](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Project:Discord)
where all nicknames of members were changed to "banned". After the joke, this
collection was used to revert the renamed users.

## Installation and running
Configure your Discord token, authorization header, server ID and nickname in
`config.json`, run `main.js` to generate a `nicks.json` file and then run
`ban.js` to change all nicknames or `unban.js` to reset them to their previous
state.
