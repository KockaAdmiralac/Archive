# util
Some utilities I used to use within my [services](https://github.com/KockaAdmiralac/services) repository, but are no longer used:

- `si-db.js`: Utility class for connecting to the [SI database](https://github.com/KockaAdmiralac/Archive/tree/master/etf/si-discord)
- `twinkle.js`: Client for receiving messages through [Twinkle's `ipc` plugin](https://github.com/Dorumin/Twinkle/tree/master/src/plugins/ipc)
