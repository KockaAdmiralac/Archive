Small projects that I've done for college that are no longer used.

Aside from directories in which projects are explained in more detail, there is also the `milokod.py` file that represents a [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) lexer for pseudo-code written by our Algorithms and Data Structures professor, used for highlighting code on a MediaWiki instance with the [SyntaxHighlight](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight) extension.
