# etf
Small projects that I've done for [School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade](https://etf.bg.ac.rs/) that are no longer used. I am no longer a student there, so most of the services I wrote for it are archived. I still, however, maintain [SI Wiki-related services](https://github.com/siwiki).

Aside from directories in which projects are explained in more detail, there is also the `milokod.py` file that represents a [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) lexer for pseudo-code written by our Algorithms and Data Structures professor, used for highlighting code on [SI Wiki](https://siwiki.rs/).
