# ORT2 diagram generator
There is a project at the [Basics of Computer Engineering 2](https://rti.etf.bg.ac.rs/rti/ir2ort2/) class that involves writing microcode and binary instructions for a simulated processor. At the time I was attending the class, our project was [different](https://github.com/KockaAdmiralac/ORT2), as this one involved a custom-made simulator named [*AORSim*](http://web.archive.org/web/20230710235701im_/https://rti.etf.bg.ac.rs/rti/ir2ort2/projekat/AORSim_V3.2.0.zip) instead of [*Logisim*](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution). The class required the students draw diagrams of their microcode operations, which took a lot of time. I decided to make this generator that reads a given AORSim configuration and microcode sequence and generates a diagram as an SVG.

Right here is attached an older version of the code that can be run as a standalone web page. The updated version is available at [SI Wiki](https://github.com/siwiki) (you will find it if you need it). It was inteded for running as a MediaWiki [gadget](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Gadgets), so some names may be MediaWiki-specific.
