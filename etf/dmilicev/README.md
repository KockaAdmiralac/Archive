Script for downloading online Keynote presentations as PDF documents, made for downloading our [Operating systems 1 presentations by our professor Dragan MiliÄ‡ev](https://afrodita.rcub.bg.ac.rs/~dmilicev/publishing/OS1/).

## Files

- `os1.sh`: Passes the right arguments to the above script to download all 5 presentations
- `bg.js`: A rather hacky approach to replacing the background on downloaded PDF documents with a white image, made by request of [@katarinajj](https://github.com/katarinajj)
- `yes.png`: The white image mentioned above
