# twinkle
I extend [Twinkle](https://github.com/Dorumin/Twinkle) with additional plugins and commands. Two of these commands were used while moderating the [SI Discord](../si-discord):

- `!siadd`: Adds a student to the SI Database, with their name, surname, year, index, Discord user ID and phone number
- `!whois`: Checks the SI database for a student given their name and surname, index and year, or Discord user ID

Since I finished my Bachelor's studies, the Twinkle instance at the SI Discord has been stopped, and so these plugins have been archived. You can the rest of the commands at the [archive of Fandom-related stuff](../../fandom/twinkle).
