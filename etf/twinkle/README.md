# twinkle
I extend [Twinkle](https://github.com/Dorumin/Twinkle) with additional plugins and commands. Two of these commands were used while moderating the [SI Discord](https://github.com/KockaAdmiralac/Archive/tree/master/etf/si-discord):

- `!siadd`: Adds a student to the SI Database, with their name, surname, year, index, Discord user ID and phone number
- `!whois`: Checks the SI database for a student given their name and surname, index and year, or Discord user ID
