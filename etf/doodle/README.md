# doodle
This used to be a service that automatically signed me up for all [Doodle](https://doodle.com/) polls that arrived to a specified email address, which I used to automatically sign up for all polls sent during my work as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant ("demonstrator") at the [School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/). It stopped working for two reasons:

1. Doodle completely changed their API (and their interface)
2. The school stopped allowing regular IMAP login through Office 365, instead requiring that all logins go through their own portal

As a result, this hasn't been working since at least October 2022. Previous commit history of the service can be found [here](https://github.com/KockaAdmiralac/services/commits/master/doodle).
