# extractor
A tool I made for interpreting [Altar.NET](https://gitlab.com/PoroCYon/Altar.NET) and [yoygames.bms](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=15)'s output for extracting [Heartbound](https://store.steampowered.com/app/567380/Heartbound/)'s sprites. Directory structure was different, and it most likely doesn't work now.
