Back in May 2022, I helped [Jacky](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/Jacky720) revert vandalism done by [a vandal](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/Ex_Kay_Cee_Dee) at [explain xkcd](https://www.explainxkcd.com/), and this was one of the scripts we used. I left it running on my server overnight, and it made Jacky accumulate over 10K reverts ([I think](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/api.php?action=query&list=users&ususers=Jacky720&usprop=editcount)). There's also `run.sh` for running the bot over and over, in case it dies.
