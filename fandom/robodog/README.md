Pretty badly made bot for April Fools 2020 and 2023.

The 2020 edition featured a bot representing a robotic [Annoying Dog](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Annoying_Dog) that overtook control of the server during the April Fools. It posted a random set of messages with a random chance of posting after every user message.

The 2023 edition was pretty similar and featured [Queen](https://deltarune.fandom.com/wiki/Queen). It additionally allowed us to run `!say` commands to get the Queen to say things.
