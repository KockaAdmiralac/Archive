On August 19, 2023, Fandom rolled out its Quick Answers feature. These questions and answers were so hilariously bad, that I had to write a script to preserve all Quick Answers sections across a wiki for laughs. The results are [here](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/User:KockaAdmiralac/Quick_Answers) and [here](https://deltarune.fandom.com/wiki/User:KockaAdmiralac/Quick_Answers).

It consists of a single `get.js` script which receives as an argument a text file with a list of all pages on the wiki. Yeah, I couldn't bother listing all the pages through the script itself.
