Miscellaneous subprojects I did while working at [Petlja](https://github.com/Petlja):
- `auto-kontrolni`: Automatically creates managed accounts for a test, distributes these accounts through the local network and deletes them when the test is finished.
- `cyrillify-resx`: A half-working cyrillification script for RESX files.
- `algora-staff-log`: More information in README of that directory
- `pygame-tests`: A WIP Pygame testing framework
