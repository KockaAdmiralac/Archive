# Geocities
These two very similar scripts were used to mass-download files from a web page,
first one from
[geocities.ws/tacticaloverload/files](http://geocities.ws/tacticaloverload/files/)
and the second one from Undertale Wiki's
[emoticons](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Chat_Emoticon_files)
category.
