# android
Various projects I've build for Android a long time ago.

- Bluetooth: Simple Bluetooth-based chat
- BTGDX: Same thing but with [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/)
- KockaNews: Some kind of a news app prototype (not really)
- Kum: Payment tracking app for a sport club (never published)

Some of these require [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/icons) or other libraries that I have not provided along with the source code.
